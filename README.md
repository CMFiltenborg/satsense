## Satsense

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/2a8eb394c4e64228b7f8501c2fadbc51)](https://app.codacy.com/app/DynaSlum/satsense?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=DynaSlum/satsense&utm_campaign=badger)

Satsense is a library for remote sensing using satellite imagery.

It is based on gdal and numpy.

* satsense - library for analysing satellite images, performance evaluation, etc.
* notebooks - IPython notebooks for illustrating and testing the usage of Satsense

## Installation
We are using python 3.5 and jupyter notebook for our code.

Assuming you have [conda](https://conda.io) installed and are in the
directory where you have checked out this repository:

```bash
conda create --name satsense python=3
source activate satsense
conda env update
```

To install satsense from the git repo in development mode use:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Examples:
Loading a file from the worldview2 satellite and displaying it:
```python
from satsense.util import load_from_file, get_rgb_image
from satsense.features import WORLDVIEW2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

imagefile = '/path/to/file/WorldView.tif'
bands = WORLDVIEW2 # The ordering of the bands in a worldview2 file

# Load the file. This will give the raw gdal file as well as a numpy
# ndarray with the bands loaded (not normalized)
dataset, image = load_from_file(imagefile)

# Convert the image to an rgb image. The original image is not
# yet normalized
true_color = get_rgb_image(image, bands, normalized=False)

plt.imshow(true_color)
```

Calculating the rgNDVI of the image:
```python
from satsense.features import rgNDVI, print_ndvi_stats

ndvi = rgNDVI(image, bands=bands)

print_ndvi_stats(ndvi)

# Display the rgNDVI inverted, because with rgNDVI low values means vegetation
plt.imshow(-ndvi)
```
